# REQUESTS

Demonstrate examples of using `requests` package  

## Reason

The requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests. It abstracts the complexities of making requests behind a simple and user-friendly API, allowing you to send HTTP requests using various methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others. The library offers many features and functionalities, including:  

* Simplified HTTP methods: Easily send HTTP requests using methods like requests.get(), requests.post(), requests.put(), requests.patch(), and requests.delete().  

* URL handling: Automatically handle URL encoding and decoding, and join URL components seamlessly.  

* Request customization: Customize your requests with headers, query parameters, and other options like timeout, proxies, and authentication.  

* Form data and file uploads: Send form data or upload files using multipart file uploads.  

* JSON support: Easily send and receive JSON data with built-in JSON encoding and decoding.  

* Handling redirects: Automatically follow redirects (with a configurable maximum number of redirects) and handle relative URLs.  

* Cookies: Automatically store and send cookies during a session using requests.Session().  

* Authentication: Support for various authentication mechanisms like Basic, Digest, and OAuth.  

* Timeouts: Set timeouts for requests to prevent them from waiting indefinitely.  

* Error handling: Raise specific exceptions for various error types, making it easier to handle errors in your code.  

* Connection pooling: Reuse existing connections to improve performance, especially for multiple requests to the same server.  

* Proxy support: Send requests via a proxy server, with support for HTTP and SOCKS proxies.  

* SSL/TLS: Verify SSL/TLS certificates and configure SSL settings.  

* Customizable: Extend the library with custom adapters and middleware to modify its behavior.
